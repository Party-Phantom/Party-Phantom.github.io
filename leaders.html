Brian is an officer of Science Olympiad, Student Council, Spanish Club, and Perspective, while also being a part of Penguin2Penguin, Ambassadors, and Mock Trial. In his free time, Brian loves to start but never finish puzzles, play co-op video games with his friends and family, and watch films and review them pretentiously on Letterboxd (Phantom of the Opera is 4.5/5 stars). As Party Chair, he seeks to advocate for affordability through progressive policies to rework and expand affordable housing initiatives and Social Security. By doing so, he hopes that a world with Party Phantom is one where no one remains hidden in the darkness.
